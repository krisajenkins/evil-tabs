* Evil Tabs

You use Emacs, you like [[https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][evil-mode]], but when you type =:tabnew= nothing
happens. Install this.

** Installation

If you're hooked up to [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]]:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
M-x package-refresh-contents
M-x package-install RET evil-tabs
#+END_EXAMPLE

Alternatively just grab the single =evil-tabs.el= file and
install that in your preferred way.
